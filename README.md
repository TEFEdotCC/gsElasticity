# gsElasticity
The gsElasticity module provides tools for structural mechanics analysis of 2D and 3D solids. This currently includes solvers for the following systems of equations:
- linear elasticity ~~(with eigenmode analysis)~~
- ~~nonlinear elasticity (with St. Venant-Kirchhoff or neo-Hookean material models)~~
- ~~incompressible elasticity (with Taylor-Hood elements)~~
- ~~thermal expansion~~
- ~~elastic meshing algorithms~~

## Installing
To use the module, configure G+Smo with `GISMO_ELASTICITY=ON`. The module source code will be automatically downloaded from GitHub.com if an internet connection is available.

## Using
For detailed examples of using the module we refer to demo applications in `/extensions/gsElasticity/examples`.
